            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Founded in 2000 by river Eze Joseph, Milagro Whitewater Rafting started as a small, family-run venture inspired by the untamed beauty of the Milagro. 
                With a passion for adventure and a deep commitment to environmental stewardship, the company quickly grew into a premier rafting outfitter known for thrilling 
                rapids, expert guides, and unforgettable journeys. 
                Today, Milagro continues to deliver exhilarating, safe, and nature-driven experiences, ensuring that every adventurer discovers the heart and soul of the 
                river—one rapid at a time.
