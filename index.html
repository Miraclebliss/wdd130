        <p>Hi, my name is Iruka Nkechi Miracle. I’m 24 years old, the fifth child in a family of seven—a position that has shaped me in more ways than one. Born in May, 
            the fifth month, I’ve always felt that my life carries a deeper purpose, a calling to do more, to be more.
           I am studying software development, not just as a career, but as a mission. I believe technology holds immense power—it can bridge gaps, solve real-world problems, 
           and change lives. To me, coding is more than just a technical skill; it’s a tool of transformation. It does not judge based on background, privilege, or circumstance,
           it only asks what you can build. I want to use this power to create solutions that matter. 
           I don’t just want to observe problems; I want to tackle them head-on, crafting innovations that uplift communities, streamline processes, and make everyday life 
           easier for people. Whether it’s developing applications that improve accessibility, writing programs that enhance education, or designing systems that empower 
           businesses, I want to be a part of something bigger than myself. At my core, I am a builder—not just of software, but of change. And this is only the beginning.
        </p>
