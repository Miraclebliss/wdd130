            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Whitewater rafting began as a means of navigating turbulent rivers, with early attempts in 1811 at Snake
                River, Wyoming. By the 1840s, Lieutenant John Fremont and Horace H.
                Day developed the first rubber raft for surveying. The sport gained momentum in the 1940s with
                inflatable pontoon rafts, and the first commercial rafting trips emerged.
                By the 1970s, rafting had become a recognized adventure activity, even appearing in the 1972 Olympic
                Games. Today, whitewater rafting is a global sport, combining
                adrenaline, nature, and teamwork, with advanced safety measures ensuring accessibility to all skill
                levels.
